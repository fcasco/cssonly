========
CSS Only
========

Here are some experiments trying what can be done with CSS only
without using Javascript.

None of these are actual recomendations, some may make more sense
than others but the only purpose is to play a little with CSS
and learn a thing or two in the process.

Feel free to fork away and use or change anything you like.
